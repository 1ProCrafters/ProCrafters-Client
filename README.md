Simple and easy to use Minecraft client for 1.8.9 (and in future, newer versions).

## Gimme it now!
First, go to [releases](https://github.com/TheKodeToad/Sol-Client/releases).

Next, download the latest version for your OS. If there is a security warning, this is because we haven't spent any money on software signing.

## Why?
There are many Minecraft clients, but they are usually closed source, and may contain malicious code.

There may be mod loaders like Forge and Fabric, which are perfectly good, but are not as simple and easy to use.

## Safety
I made the code for this client available, because not enough clients are open source (even OptiFine is closed source).

If you are suspicous, you can look at the code.

This client has been tested by multiple people on Hypixel, and it disables disallowed mods automatically.
